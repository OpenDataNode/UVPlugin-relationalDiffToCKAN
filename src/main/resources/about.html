<b>L-RelationalDiffToCkan loader</b> can be used load database tables stored in internal dataunit relational database <br/>
to CKAN as CKAN datastore resource. Name of CKAN resource is the same as name of the input table.
<p/>
First time L-RelationalDiffToCkan DPU runs, it loads all the data from source table into CKAN datastore.
<br/>Each next run of DPU updates data based on data in source database table. It adds new data, modifies existing data if any changes (based on primary key(s))
<br/> and deletes data that no more exist in source database table (deleted_timestamp set in CKAN datastore, they are not physically deleted)
<p/>
In order to work properly, these two parameters must be set in backend config.properties:
<ul>
	<li><b>org.opendatanode.CKAN.api.url</b> - URL of CKAN API</li>
	<li><b>org.opendatanode.CKAN.secret.token</b> - authentication token for target CKAN</li>
</ul>
<p/>
<br/>
Also, prior to running this DPU, an association between pipeline and CKAN dataset must exist, otherwise DPU fails 

<p/>
List of options:
<ul>
	<li><b>CKAN resource name</b> - (required) Name of resource to be created in CKAN. It should not change between pipeline runs as this name
	is used as key to CKAN.
</ul>
